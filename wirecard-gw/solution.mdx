## Key Manganagement and Proccess

• **Asymmetric Smart Card Key Pair**: Using to encrypt/decrypt TMK.

• **TMK**: Terminal Master Key - Using to encrypt/decrypt DEK&MPK. Each POS terminal has a
different TMK.

• **DEK**: Data Encryption Key – Using to encrypt the client data.

• **MPK**: Message Protection Key – To make sure of the perfection of data.
